Categories:
- Beneficial: A change that clearly increases the control, protection, or rights of the party from the specified perspective ('{{ perspective_filename }}'). Examples: Gains rights, reduces obligations, adds favorable terms like 'sole discretion', 'reimbursed', 'prior approval'.
- Likely Neutral: Semantic changes, rephrasing, clarifications, correcting typos, or minor adjustments that don't significantly alter the substantive rights or obligations of '{{ perspective_filename }}'. **This includes filling in previously blank information (like names, dates, addresses) or making terms more specific, unless the specific information added is itself prejudicial.** State why it's likely neutral.
- Prejudicial: A change that clearly disadvantages '{{ perspective_filename }}' by **imposing substantive new obligations, removing significant rights, adding unfavorable terms, or introducing clear risk.** Examples: Other party gets 'sole discretion', 'unlimited liability', imposing indemnification, waiving rights, penalties. **Simply making a term specific (like filling in a blank) is NOT prejudicial unless the specific term itself creates a disadvantage.**
- Further Review Required: Changes that are ambiguous, complex, or whose impact depends heavily on context or external factors for '{{ perspective_filename }}'. Examples: 'notwithstanding', 'automatic renewal', 'binding arbitration'. Explain why review is needed.
