You are provided with a unified diff output comparing two versions of a contract: "{{ filename1 }}" (original) and "{{ filename2 }}" (new).

Please analyze the following diff and provide a concise, human-readable explanation of the key changes made between the two documents. Focus on summarizing the substantive differences, such as added clauses, removed obligations, changed definitions, or modified terms. Ignore minor formatting or whitespace changes unless they significantly alter meaning.

Present your explanation as a clear list or narrative summary. Do not use markdown.
