Analyze the following contract document based ONLY on the requirements listed in the CATEGORY_REQUIREMENTS_SCHEMA provided below for the specific contract type: '{{ contract_category }}'.

For each criterion in the schema, determine if it is met based *solely* on the document content and provide a brief explanation referencing the document.
For the `met` field, respond with:
- `true` if the requirement is clearly and fully met.
- `false` if the requirement is clearly not met or missing.
- `"maybe"` (as a string) if the requirement is ambiguous, partially met, or there's significant uncertainty based on the text.

Respond ONLY with a JSON object containing key-value pairs, where the key is the criterion `id` from the schema and the value is an object `{ "met": <boolean | "maybe">, "explanation": "..." }`, like the example provided.
