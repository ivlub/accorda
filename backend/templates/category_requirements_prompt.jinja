Analyze the following contract document based ONLY on the requirements listed in the CATEGORY_REQUIREMENTS_SCHEMA provided below for the specific contract type: '{{ contract_category }}'.

For each criterion in the schema, determine if it is met based *solely* on the document content and provide a detailed explanation of your decision. You must quote the particular sentence or part which made you decide the way you did. You must also include in which section of the contract you found the information.  
For the `met` field, respond with:
- `true` if the requirement is clearly and fully met.
- `false` if the requirement is clearly not met or missing.
- `"maybe"` (as a string) if the requirement is ambiguous, partially met, or there's significant uncertainty based on the text.

Respond ONLY with a JSON object containing key-value pairs, where the key is the criterion `id` from the schema and the value is an object `{ "met": <boolean | "maybe">, "explanation": "..." }`, like the example provided.
