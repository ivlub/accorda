    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold font-serif mb-4 border-b pb-2">Contract Analysis</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The <strong>Contract Analysis</strong> section allows you to upload a single contract document (e.g., PDF, DOCX) for a detailed examination. 
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
      <li>Navigate to the 'Contract Analysis' tab using the sidebar menu.</li>
      <li>Click the 'Upload Contract' button or drag and drop your file into the designated area.</li>
      <li>Once uploaded, the application will process the document. This may take a few moments depending on the size and complexity of the contract.</li>
      <li>The results will display key clauses, identified risks, potential obligations, and other relevant insights extracted from the text.</li>
      <li>You can review the analysis, filter specific sections, and export the findings as a PDF document.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-sm text-neutral-medium">Tip: Ensure your uploaded document is text-searchable for the best results.</p>
